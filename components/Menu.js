//Menu that accepts items with this syntax {title/iconName:link} and arrays them in a list
//Can be set to go vertically or horizontally. Uses unordered list? Needs to be a11y friendly but lists are more cumbersome than flex
//Items are clickable, will change cursor type, can have hover background change, corner radius
//Reqs: Icon, Row
//Props: hori, vert, margin-btwn-item, hover-color, corner-radius
